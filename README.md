## Features

*   **User Interface:** Intuitive and responsive UI for mobile devices.
*   **User Authentication:** Login and registration flows.
*   **League & Season Management:** Create, join, and view details of leagues and seasons.
*   **Game Play:** Interactive timer for blind levels, player elimination, and game state display.
*   **Standings:** View player standings within a season.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with React Native for iOS and Android.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** React Native
*   **Development Platform:** Expo
*   **Language:** JavaScript (with TypeScript support via Expo)
*   **UI/UX:** Material Design principles (implied by general modern app design)
*   **API Communication:** Fetch API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher.
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):** Comes with Node.js.
*   **Expo CLI:** Install globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
*   **Android Studio / Xcode:** For emulators/simulators, or a physical device with the Expo Go app.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JonCastelline/PokerLeague-V2
    cd PokerLeague-V2
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Backend API URL:**
    The application needs to know where your backend API is running. You will need to update the `API_BASE_URL` in `src/config.js`.
    *   For local development, this will typically be `http://<your-local-ip>:8080` (replace `<your-local-ip>` with your computer's IP address on your local network, as `localhost` won't work from an emulator/device).
    *   For production, this will be your Render backend service URL.

## Running the Development Server

To start the Expo development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```
This will open a new tab in your browser with the Expo Dev Tools. From there, you can:
*   Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your physical device.
*   Run on an Android emulator.
*   Run on an iOS simulator.
*   Run in a web browser (limited functionality).

## Running Tests

Currently, automated frontend tests are not configured. Manual testing is performed.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed using Expo Application Services (EAS). Refer to the Expo documentation for details on building and deploying for production.
